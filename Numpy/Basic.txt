What is Numpy ? 
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

Why use Numpy ?
1. Provides efficient storage
2. It also provides better ways of handling data for processing
3. It is fast
4. Numpy uses relatively less memory to store data

Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?
NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.

This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.

Which Language is NumPy written in?
NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.

Create a NumPy ndarray Object : 
The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.
We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.

Array Creation Methods : 
1. Conversion from other Python structures (i.e. lists and tuples) : To create an ndarray, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the array() method, and it will be converted into an ndarray.

arr = numpy.array([1,2,3,4])

Dimensions in Arrays :
A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays).

nested array: are arrays that have arrays as their elements.

0-D Arrays :
0-D arrays, or Scalars, are the elements in an array. Each value in an array is a 0-D array.

arr = np.array(42)

1-D Arrays : 
An array that has 0-D arrays as its elements is called uni-dimensional or 1-D array.

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

2-D Arrays : 
An array that has 1-D arrays as its elements is called a 2-D array.
These are often used to represent matrix or 2nd order tensors.

NumPy has a whole sub module dedicated towards matrix operations called numpy.mat
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

Check Number of Dimensions?
NumPy Arrays provides the ndim attribute that returns an integer that tells us how many dimensions the array have.

Higher Dimensional Arrays : 
An array can have any number of dimensions.
When the array is created, you can define the number of dimensions by using the ndmin argument.

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4], ndmin=5)

Checking the Data Type of an Array
The NumPy array object has a property called dtype that returns the data type of the array

Get the Shape of an Array : 
NumPy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns a tuple with each index having the number of corresponding elements.

Reshaping arrays : 
Reshaping means changing the shape of an array.
The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.
By reshaping we can add or remove dimensions or change number of elements in each dimension.

2. Intrinsic NumPy array creation functions (e.g. arange, ones, zeros, etc.) :
